# e-commerce-project
E-commerce project using React, Redux, and Node.js, which included product listings, shopping cart functionality, admin panel and secure checkout. I created a responsive user interface using React and Redux, and developed a RESTful API using Node.js with MongoDB for handling database queries and user authentication.
